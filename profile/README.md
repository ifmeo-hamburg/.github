## Hi there 👋

This is the organisation for the [Experimental Oceanography](http://eleanorfrajka.com) group of the [University of Hamburg](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en.html).  Repositories here are developed by current and past group members and colleagues, and consist of coursebooks for teaching, code for processing oceanographic data, and for analysing data.

- [amocarray](http://github.com/AMOCCommunity/amocarray) - for loading data from overturning transport arrays (e.g., RAPID, OSNAP, MOVE, SAMBA)
- [seagliderOG1](http://github.com/ifmeo-hamburg/seagliderOG1) - for translation Seaglider basestation files to [OG1](https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/OG-format-user-manual/OG_Format.html) format.
- [WBTSdata](http://github.com/ifmeo-hamburg/WBTSdata) - for loading hydrographic/LADCP data from the Western Boundary Time Series at 26.5°N in the Atlantic
- [glidertest](http://github.com/oceangliderscommunity/glidertest) - for carrying out tests to evaluate data foibles on glider data in [OG1](https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/OG-format-user-manual/OG_Format.html) format.
- [fetchAZA](http://github.com/eleanorfrajka/fetchAZA) - for loading and standarising data from the Sonardyne FetchAZA pressure sensor.
- [ctd-tools](http://github.com/ifmeo-hamburg/ctd-tools) - for loading data in various formats from oceanographic instruments

Coursebooks:

- [seaocn](http://github.com/ifmeo-hamburg/seaocn) - for MSc Seagoing Oceanography in Summer Semester 2024
- [messfern](http://github.com/ifmeo-hamburg/messfern) - for BSc Messmethoden (und Fernerkundung) practical exercises in Winter Semester 2024/25
- [regoz](http://github.com/ifmeo-hamburg/regoz) - for BSc Regional Oceanography practical exercises in Summer Semester 2024

Getting started:
- [template-project](http://github.com/eleanorfrajka/template-project) - a template for a python project demonstrating a minimum working example with the features and project structure recommended for this gorup.
